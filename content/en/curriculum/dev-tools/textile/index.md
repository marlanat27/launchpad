Tableland is a web3 native SQL database that enables mutability, structure, and advanced querying for data stored via IPFS and Filecoin. 

Tableland can be used to enable advanced experiences like mutable file systems built on top of IPFS or Filecoin, dynamic NFTs, community reputation tracking, and more.
